        In that book of Habermas's which specifically addresses the issue of socalled 'post-structuralism', Der philosophische Diskurs der Modeme, there is
        a curious detail concerning Lacan's name: it is mentioned only five times
        and each time in conjunction with other names. (Let us cite all five
        instances: p. 70 - 'von Hegel und Marx bis Nietzsche und Heidegger, von
        Bataille und Lacan bis Foucault und Derrida'; p. 120 - 'Bataille, Lacan und
        Foucault'; p. 311 - 'mit Levi-Strauss und Lacan'; p. 313 - 'den zeitgenossischen Strukturalismus, die Ethnologie von Levi-Strauss und die Lacanische
        Psychoanalyse'; p. 359 - von Freud oder c. G. Jung, von Lacan oder LeviStrauss'.) Lacanian theory is not, then, perceived as a specific entity; it is
        - to use Laclau and Mouffe's term - always articulated in a series of equivalences. Why this refusal to confront Lacan directly, in a book which
        includes lengthy discussions ofBataille, Derrida and, above all, Foucault,
        the real partner of Habermas? 
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer to this enigma is to be found in another curiosity of the
        Habermas book, in a curious incident concerning Althusser. of course, we
        are using the term 'curious incident' in a Sherlock Holmesian sense:
        Althusser's name is not even mentioned in Habermas's book, and that is
        the curious incident. So our first thesis would be that the great debate
        occupying the foreground of today's intellectual scene, the HabermasFoucault debate, is masking another opposition, another debate' which is
        theoretically more far-reaching: the Althusser -Lacan debate. There is something enigmatic in the sudden eclipse of the Althusserian school: it cannot
        be explained away in terms of a theoretical defeat. It is more as if there were, in Althusser's theory, a traumatic kernel which had to be quickly
        forgotten, 'repressed'; it is an effective case of theoretical amnesia. Why,
        then, was the opposition Althusser-Lacan replaced, in a kind of
        metaphorical substitution, by the opposition Habermas-Foucault? At
        stake here are four different ethical positions, and at the same time four
        different notions of the subject. [...]

  <h3>Part I The Symptom</h3>

    <header>How Did Marx Invent the Symptom?</header>
      <article>
          <p>
            <i>Marx, Freud: the ana!JIsis afform </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Lacan, it was none other than Karl Marx who invented the
            notion of symptom. Is this Lacanian thesis just a sally of wit, a vague
            analogy, or does it possess a pertinent theoretical foundation? If Marx
            really articulated the notion of the symptom as it is also at work in the
            Freudian field, then we must ask ourselves the Kantian question, concerning the epistemological 'conditions of possibility' of such an encounter:
            how was it possible for Marx, in his analysis of the world of commodities,
            to produce a notion which applies also to the analysis of dreams, hysterical
            phenomena, and so on? 
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer is that there is a fundamental homology between the
            interpretative procedure of Marx and Freud - more precisely, between
            their analysis of commodity and of dreams. In both cases the point is to
            avoid the properly fetishistic fascination of the 'content' supposedly hidden
            behind the form: the 'secret' to be unveiled through analysis is not the
            content hidden by the form (the form of commodities, the form of dreams)
            but, on the contrary, the secret' afthis form itself The theoretical intelligence
            of the form of dreams does not consist in penetrating from the manifest
            content to its 'hidden kernel', to the latent dream- thoughts; it consists in
            the answer to the question: why have the latent dream-thoughts assumed
            such a form, why were they transposed into the form of a dream? It is the
            same with commodities: the real pro blem is not to penetrate to the 'hidden
            kernel' of the commodity - the determination of its value by the quantity
            of the work consumed in its production - but to explain why workassumed
            the form of the value of a commodity, why it can affirm its social character
            only in the commodity-form of its product. [...]

            <h5>The Dialectics of the Symptom</h5>
            <i>Back to the future </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            The only reference ro the domain of science fiction in Lacan's work concerns
            the time paradox: in his first seminar, Lacan uses Norbert Wiener's
            metaphor of the inverted direction of time to explain the symptom as a
            'return of the repressed':
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>
              Wiener posits two beings each of whose temporal dimensions moves
              in the opposite direction from the other.
            </code>
            <code>
              To be sure, that means nothing, and that is how things which mean nothing all of a sudden signify
              something, but in a quite different domain.
            </code>
            <code>
              If one of them sends a message to the other, for example a square, the being going in the
              opposite direction will first of all see the square vanishing, before seeing
              the square.
            </code>
            <code>
              That is what we see as well.
            </code>
            <code>
              The symptom initially appears
              to us as a trace, which will only ever be a trace, one which will continue
              not to be understood until the analysis has got quite a long way, and
              until we have realized its meaning.' 
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            The analysis is thus conceived as a symbolization, a symbolic integration
            of meaningless imaginary traces; this conception implies a fundamentally 
            imaginary character of the unconscious: it is made of'imaginary fixations
            which could not have been assimilated to the symbolic development' of
            the subject's history; consequently, it is 'something which will be realized
            in the Symbolic, or, more precisely, something which, thanks to the
            symbolic progress which takes place in the analysis, will have been'. [...]

  <h3>Part II Lack in the Other </h3>

            <h5>Identity</h5>
            <i>The ideological quilt'</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            What creates and sustains the identi!J of a given ideological field beyond
            all possible variations ofits positive content? HegemonyandSocialistStrategy
            delineates what is probably the definitive answer to this crucial question
            of the theory of ideology: the multitude of 'floating signifiers', of pro toideological elements, is structured into a unified field through the intervention of a certain 'nodal point' (the Lacanian point de capiton) which
            'quilts' them, stops their sliding and fLXes their meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ideological space is made of non-bound, non-tied elements, 'floating
            signifiers', whose very identity is 'open', overdetermined by their
            articulation in a chain with other elements - that is, their 'literal'
            signification depends on their metaphorical surplus-signification.
            Ecologism, for example: its connection with other ideological elements
            is not detetmined in advance; one can be a state-orientated ecologist (if
            one believes that only the intervention of a strong state can save us from
            catastrophe), a socialist ecologist (if one locates the source of merciless
            exploitation of nature in the capitalist system), a conservative ecologist
            [if one preaches that man must again become deeply rooted in his native
            soil), and so on;fiminism can be socialist, apolitical; even racism could be
            elitist or populist ... The 'quilting' performs the totalization by means
            of which this free floating of ideological elements is halted, fixed - that is to say, by means of which they become parts of the structured network
            of meaning. [...]

          <i>Between the two death</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            The connection between the death drive and the symbolic order is a
            constant with Lacan, but we can differentiate the various stages of his
            teaching precisely by reference to the different modes of atticulation of
            the death drive and the signifier: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In the first period (the first seminar, The Function and the Field oj
                Speech and Language ... J, it is the Hegelian phenomenological idea
                that the word is a death, a murder of a thing: as soon as the reality
                is symbolized, caught in a symbolic network, the thing itselfis more
                present in a word, in its concept, than in its immediate physical
                reality. More precisely, we cannot return to the immediate reality:
                even if we turn from the word to the thing - from the word 'table'
                to the table in its physical reality, for example - the appearance of
                the table itself is already marked with a certain lack - to know what
                a table really is, what it means, we must have recourse to the word
                which implies an absence of the thing
              </li>
              <li>
                In the second period (the Lacanian reading of Poe' s 'Purloined Letter'),
                the accent is shifted from the word, speech, to language as a
                synchronic structure, a senseless autonomous mechanism which
                produces meaning as its effect. If, in the first period, the Lacanian
                concept oflanguage is still basically a phenomenological one (Lacan
                constantly repeats that the field of psychoanalysis is the field of
                meaning, fa signification), here we have a 'structuralist' conception
                oflanguage as a differential system of elements. The death drive is
                now identified with the symbolic order itself: in Lacan's own words,
                it is 'nothing but a mask of the symbolic order'. The main thing
                here is the opposition between the imaginary level of the experience
                of meaning and the meaningless signifier/signifying mechanism
                producing it. The imaginary level is governed by the pleasure principle, it is striving for a homeostatic balance, and the symbolic order
                in its blind automatism is always troubling this homeostasis: it is
                'beyond the pleasure principle'. When the human being is caught in
                the signifier's network, this network has a morti£Ying effect on him;
                he becomes part of a strange automatic order disturbing his natural
                homeostatic balance (through compulsive repetition, for example).
              </li>
              <li>
                In the third period, in which the main accent ofLacan's teaching is
                put on the Real as impossible, the death drive again radically
                changes its signification. This change can be most easily detected
                through the relationship between the pleasure principle and the
                symbolic order.
              </li>
              <li>
                Until the end of 1950S, the pleasure principle was identified with
                the imaginary level: the symbolic order was conceived as the realm
                'beyond the pleasure principle'. But starting from the late 1950S (the
                Seminar on The Ethic ofPsychoanafysis), it is, in contrast, the symbolic
                order itself which is identified with the pleasure principle: the
                unconscious 'structured like a language', its 'primary process' of
                metonymic-metaphoric displacement, is governed by the pleasure
                principle; what lies beyond is not the symbolic order but a real kernel,
                a traumatic core. To designate it, Lacan uses a Freudian term: das
                Ding, the Thing as an incarnation of the impossible jouissance (the
                term Thing is to be taken here with all the connotations it possesses
                in the domain of horror science fiction: the 'alien' from the film of
                the same name is a pre-symbolic, maternal Thing par excellence). 
              </li>
              <li>
                The symbolic order is striving for a homeostatic balance, but
                there is in its kernel, at its very centre, some strange, traumatic
                element which cannot be symbolized, integrated into the symbolic
                order -the Thing. Lacan coined a neologism for it: l'extimite-external
                intimacy, which served as a title for one ofJacques-Alain Miller's
                Seminars. And what, at this level, is the death drive? Exactly the
                opposite of the symbolic order: the possibility of the 'second death',
                the radical annihilation of the symbolic texture through which
                so-called reality is constituted. The very existence of the symbolic
                order implies a possibility of its radical effacement, of 'symbolic
                death' - not the death of the so-called 'real object' in its symbol, but
                the obliteration of the signifying network itself.
